# Deployment Fixes Applied - Render Build Issue

## Problem Identified
Render deployment was failing with Rust compilation error during dependency installation:
```
error: failed to create directory `/usr/local/cargo/registry/cache/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f`
Caused by: Read-only file system (os error 30)
```

## Root Cause
The `alembic==1.12.0` package in requirements.txt was attempting to compile Rust components which failed in Render's read-only build environment.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Created Clean Requirements File
Created `requirements_render.txt` with minimal dependencies that don't require Rust compilation:
```
aiogram==3.1.1
aiohttp==3.8.5
aiosqlite==0.19.0
flask==3.0.0
psutil==5.9.5
psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
sqlalchemy==2.0.21
watchdog==3.0.0
```

### 2. Updated Build Commands
Updated both `render.yaml` and `render-deploy.json` to use the clean requirements file:
- Web service: `pip install -r requirements_render.txt`
- Worker service: `pip install -r requirements_render.txt`

### 3. Removed Problematic Dependencies
- **Removed:** `alembic==1.12.0` (causes Rust compilation errors)
- **Kept:** All essential dependencies for bot functionality

## Impact
- Bot retains all core functionality
- No database migration features (not currently used)
- Clean, faster deployment process
- Compatible with Render's build environment

## Testing Required
After deployment, verify:
1. Bot starts successfully
2. All commands work (/start, /admin)
3. Payment system functional
4. Database operations work
5. Background worker processes correctly

## Files Modified
- `requirements_render.txt` - New clean requirements file
- `render.yaml` - Updated build commands
- `render-deploy.json` - Updated build commands

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment with updated requirements
2. Monitor for any missing functionality
3. Add back dependencies only if needed and compatible
