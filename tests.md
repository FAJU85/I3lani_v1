# Testing Documentation - I3lani Bot

## Test Types

### 1. Manual Testing
- **Location**: `manual-test-checklist.md`
- **Purpose**: Step-by-step manual verification of all features
- **Frequency**: Before each deployment
- **Coverage**: All user-facing functionality

### 2. Automated Testing
- **Status**: Not implemented (recommended for future)
- **Types needed**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **Framework recommendation**: pytest for Python components

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Load testing**: Manual simulation of concurrent users
- **Memory monitoring**: Track memory usage over time
- **Response time**: Measure bot response times

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt

# Set test environment variables
export BOT_TOKEN="test_bot_token"
export ADMIN_IDS="test_admin_id"
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///test_bot.db"
```

### Test Database
Use separate test database to avoid production data contamination:
```python
# Test database configuration
TEST_DATABASE_PATH = "test_bot.db"
```

## Critical Test Cases

### 1. Bot Startup
```python
# Test: Bot initializes without errors
# Expected: All components load successfully
async def test_bot_startup():
    # Initialize bot
    # Verify database connection
    # Check all handlers loaded
    # Confirm channel discovery works
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```python
# Test: Payment flow works correctly
# Expected: Payments processed and confirmed
async def test_payment_flow():
    # Test TON payment creation
    # Test Stars payment creation
    # Test payment confirmation
    # Test payment timeout handling
```

### 3. Multi-language Support
```python
# Test: Language switching works
# Expected: All text appears in correct language
async def test_language_switching():
    # Test language selection
    # Test persistence across sessions
    # Test all supported languages
```

## Test Data

### Test Users
- Admin user: Use real admin ID from environment
- Regular user: Create test user ID
- Referral user: Test referral system

### Test Channels
- Use real channels where bot is admin
- Minimum 2 channels for multi-channel testing
- Test both public and private channels

### Test Payments
- Use small amounts for testing
- Test both TON and Stars payments
- Verify payment confirmation system

## Test Execution

### Manual Test Execution
1. Follow `manual-test-checklist.md` step by step
2. Document results in `issues.md`
3. Mark passed/failed for each test case
4. Report any bugs found

### Automated Test Execution (Future)
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/test_payments.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

## Test Results Documentation

### Test Reports
- Document test results in `issues.md`
- Include screenshots for UI issues
- Log error messages for debugging

### Bug Tracking
- Use issue template in `issues.md`
- Assign priority levels
- Track fix status

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- Average response: < 1 second
- 95th percentile: < 2 seconds
- 99th percentile: < 5 seconds

### Memory Usage
- Baseline: < 100MB
- Growth rate: < 10MB/hour
- Maximum: < 500MB

### Error Rates
- Overall error rate: < 1%
- Payment errors: < 2%
- Database errors: < 0.5%

## Test Automation Recommendations

### Unit Tests
```python
# Test individual functions
def test_user_creation():
    # Test database user creation
    pass

def test_price_calculation():
    # Test dynamic pricing logic
    pass

def test_language_detection():
    # Test language system
    pass
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# Test component interactions
def test_payment_integration():
    # Test payment flow end-to-end
    pass

def test_admin_panel():
    # Test admin functionality
    pass
```

### End-to-End Tests
```python
# Test complete user workflows
def test_ad_creation_flow():
    # Test complete ad creation
    pass

def test_referral_system():
    # Test referral workflow
    pass
```

## Test Environment Management

### Development Testing
- Use local SQLite database
- Mock external API calls
- Test with limited channels

### Staging Testing
- Use staging environment
- Test with real API connections
- Verify all integrations work

### Production Testing
- Limited testing on production
- Monitor performance metrics
- Quick smoke tests after deployment

## Continuous Integration (Future)

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.11
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/
```
