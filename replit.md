## Changelog

- July 07, 2025. Initial setup
- July 07, 2025. Critical syntax error fix - Fixed SyntaxError in handlers.py where error_recovery_handler function had malformed try-except block. Completed the try-except structure with proper error handling and fixed keyboard configuration. Bot now starts successfully without syntax errors.
- July 07, 2025. Complete codebase cleanup and bug fixes - Removed all duplicate files, unused imports, and redundant code. Fixed duplicate function definitions, removed unused modules (debug_system, flow_validator, keyboards, models, scheduler, referral_system), cleaned up import statements, and consolidated configuration into core files. Removed 20+ duplicate/unused files, fixed all import errors, and streamlined codebase to essential components only. Bot now runs with clean, optimized code structure.
- July 07, 2025. Dynamic channel management system - Implemented automatic channel detection and management. Bot now automatically adds channels to the database when it becomes an administrator and removes them when admin privileges are revoked. No more static channel configuration - only channels where bot is admin are available for advertising. Added channel_manager.py with ChatMemberUpdated handlers, database methods for automatic channel management, and multilingual error messages for no channels available.
- July 07, 2025. Enhanced channel analytics and auto-detection - Added comprehensive channel analysis when bot becomes admin. System now automatically detects: channel name, total subscribers, estimated active subscribers (45% of total), post count estimation, category detection (technology, shopping, news, entertainment, education, business, sports, general), dynamic pricing based on subscriber count and category, detailed channel descriptions. Added admin command /admin_channel_details for viewing complete channel analytics. Database schema extended with new fields: active_subscribers, total_posts, category, description, last_updated.
- July 07, 2025. Removed pricing button and cleaned up interfaces - Removed pricing button from main menu and all bot interfaces per user request.

Streamlined user experience by removing unnecessary pricing navigation.
- July 07, 2025. Fixed translation bugs and improved multilingual support - Identified and fixed multiple translation issues including hard-coded English text in error messages, help command, and UI elements. Enhanced language system with proper error message translations, added missing translation keys for common messages, and ensured all user-facing text properly uses get_text() function with fallback support. Translation system now works correctly for English, Arabic, and Russian languages.
