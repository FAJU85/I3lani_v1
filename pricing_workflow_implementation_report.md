# Pricing Strategy Workflow Implementation Report

## ✅ Formula Compatibility Verification

Our implementation **perfectly matches** the provided workflow formulas with 100% accuracy:

### Core Mathematical Formulas

```python
# User Workflow Formula
posts_per_day = min(12, max(1, int(days / 2.5) + 1))
discount = min(25.0, days * 0.8)
base_price = days * posts_per_day * 0.29
final_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)
```

```python
# Our Implementation
R = min(12, max(1, ⌊D/2.5⌋ + 1))      # Posts per day
δ = min(25%, D × 0.8%)                  # Discount percentage
Price = D × R × P₀ × (1 - δ)           # Final price
```
