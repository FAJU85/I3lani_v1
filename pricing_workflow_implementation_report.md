# Quantitative Pricing System Implementation Report

## ‚úÖ Mathematical Formula Implementation Complete

### 1. **Posts Per Day Formula**
```
R = min(12, max(1, ‚åäD/2.5‚åã + 1))
```
- **Validation**: 100% accurate across all test cases
- **Examples**: 1 day = 1 post, 3 days = 2 posts, 5 days = 3 posts, 8 days = 4 posts, 30 days = 12 posts

### 2. **Discount Formula**
```
Œ¥ = min(25%, D √ó 0.8%)
```
- **Validation**: 100% accurate across all test cases
- **Examples**: 1 day = 0.8%, 3 days = 2.4%, 30 days = 24.0%, 32+ days = 25.0% (capped)

### 3. **Price Calculation Formula**
```
Price = D √ó R √ó P‚ÇÄ √ó (1 - Œ¥)
```
- **Base Price**: P‚ÇÄ = $0.29 per post per day
- **Minimum Price**: $0.29 enforced after discount
- **Validation**: 100% accurate with user specifications

## üìä Pricing Matrix Verification

| Days | Posts/Day | Discount | Final Price | Posting Interval |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1    | 1         | 0.8%     | $0.29       | Once daily       |
| 2    | 1         | 1.6%     | $0.57       | Once daily       |
| 3    | 2         | 2.4%     | $1.70       | Every 12 hours   |
| 4    | 2         | 3.2%     | $2.25       | Every 12 hours   |
| 5    | 3         | 4.0%     | $4.18       | Every 8 hours    |
| 8    | 4         | 6.4%     | $8.69       | Every 6 hours    |
| 10   | 5         | 8.0%     | $13.34      | Every 4 hours    |
| 30   | 12        | 24.0%    | $79.34      | Every 2 hours    |

## ‚è∞ Posting Schedule System

### Even Distribution Examples
- **1 post/day**: 00:00 (once daily)
- **2 posts/day**: 00:00, 12:00 (every 12 hours)
- **3 posts/day**: 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 (every 8 hours)
- **4 posts/day**: 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 (every 6 hours)
- **12 posts/day**: 00:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00 (every 2 hours)

### Rate Limits Compliance
- **Max posts per 30 seconds**: 1 post (API protection)
- **Min interval between posts**: 30 seconds
- **Daily distribution**: Even spread across 24 hours

## üéØ User Interface Implementation

### Current Status
The mathematical formulas are implemented and working correctly. The user interface needs to display:

```
üîΩ {Days_select} üîº
Auto-calculated:
üß≤ {Posts_per_Day} posts/day
üéÅ {%_Discount} discount
üíé {TON_price} TON
‚≠ê {Stars_price} Stars
üí≤ {USD_price} USD
```

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Day Selection**: Interactive controls for any day (1-365)
2. **Auto-calculation**: Real-time updates based on mathematical formulas
3. **Multi-currency**: USD, TON, Stars conversion
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear display of calculated values

## üîß Technical Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Mathematical formula implementation
- Posts per day calculation
- Discount percentage calculation
- Price calculation with minimum enforcement
- Posting schedule generation
- Comprehensive test suite (100% pass rate)

### üîÑ Next Steps
1. Update user interface to show auto-calculated values
2. Implement day selection controls
3. Add real-time price updates
4. Integrate with existing bot workflow
