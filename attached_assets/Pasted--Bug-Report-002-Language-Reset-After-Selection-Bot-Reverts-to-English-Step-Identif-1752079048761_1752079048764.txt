## 🐞 Bug Report #002 – Language Reset After Selection (Bot Reverts to English)

**🔖 Step Identifier:** Global – Language Selection and Persistence  
**📁 Affected Files/Modules:** `handlers/start.py`, `core/language.py`, possibly `main.py`  
**📌 Description:**  
When the user selects a different language (e.g., Arabic or Russian) after starting the bot, the language seems to apply only to the **current message**.  
In the following steps, the bot reverts back to **English**, and continues using English until the end of the process — even though the user already changed the language.

---

### ✅ Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the bot — the welcome message is in English.
2. Select Arabic (or any language other than English).
3. Observe that:
   - The current menu changes to Arabic.
   - But the **next step (e.g., ad creation)** reverts to English.
   - The same happens through the rest of the process.

### 🎯 Expected Behavior:
- When a user selects a language:
  - It should be **persistently stored** (e.g., in DB or in-memory)
  - All subsequent messages and buttons should use that language
  - The bot should not default back to English unless the user changes it again

---

### 🚫 Actual Behavior:
- The language is applied **only to the current message**.
- Next steps default back to English (assumed fallback).
- User must re-select language manually each time, which is not supported.

---

### 📎 Notes:
- This suggests that the selected language (`user_lang`) is:
  - Not being saved to the database or session
  - Or is saved but not **reloaded** before each step
- May require a global `get_user_lang(user_id)` helper to be used at the beginning of every step

---

### 🛠 Suggested Fix:
- After language selection, store the value (e.g., `"ar"`, `"ru"`) in the user record.
- In every handler and step, load the language using a central function:
  ```python
  lang = get_user_lang(user_id)
  text = get_text(lang, "some_key")
