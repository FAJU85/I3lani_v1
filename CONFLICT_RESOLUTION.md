# Bot Conflict Resolution Guide

## Problem
The bot is showing: "Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request; make sure that only one bot instance is running"

## Causes
1. **Another instance is running** - Someone else is using the same bot token
2. **Development vs Production** - Bot running on another server
3. **Multiple developers** - Team members testing with same token

## Solutions

### Option 1: Get a New Bot Token (Easiest)
1. Go to @BotFather on Telegram
2. Create a new bot or use `/revoke` to get new token
3. Update BOT_TOKEN in your environment

### Option 2: Stop Other Instances
1. Check if bot is running on other servers
2. Ask team members to stop their instances
3. Check deployment platforms (Heroku, VPS, etc.)

### Option 3: Use Webhook Mode (Best for Production)
- Webhooks allow multiple deployments without conflicts
- Each deployment gets its own webhook URL
- No polling conflicts

### Option 4: Use Different Bot for Development
- Create a development bot (@YourBot_Dev)
- Use production bot token only in production
- Keep tokens separate

## Webhook Implementation
The bot can be updated to use webhooks:
- Set webhook URL: https://yourdomain.com/webhook
- Bot receives updates via POST requests
- No polling = no conflicts
