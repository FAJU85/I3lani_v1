# Deploy I3lani Bot to Railway

Railway.app is another excellent hosting platform that's perfect for deploying your Telegram bot. It offers free tier hosting with PostgreSQL database support.

## Why Railway?

- **Free Tier:** $5 worth of credits monthly (enough for small bots)
- **PostgreSQL:** Free managed database included
- **GitHub Integration:** One-click deployment from GitHub
- **Automatic Deployments:** Updates when you push to GitHub
- **Simple Setup:** Even easier than Render
- **Better Performance:** Often faster than other free platforms

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Upload to GitHub First
1. Create repository: `i3lani-bot`
2. Upload all project files (extract from ZIP)
3. Make repository public
4. Include `railway.json` configuration file

### 2. Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" â†’ "Login with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your repositories
4. You'll get $5 free credits monthly

### 3. Deploy Database
1. Click "New Project"
2. Choose "Provision PostgreSQL"
3. Database will be created automatically
4. Copy the connection details (auto-generated)

### 4. Deploy Bot Service
1. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select your repository: `yourusername/i3lani-bot`
3. Railway auto-detects Python and uses `railway.json`
4. Deployment starts automatically

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
In your Railway dashboard:

**Required Variables:**
- `BOT_TOKEN` = Your bot token from @BotFather
- `ADMIN_IDS` = Your Telegram user ID
- `DATABASE_URL` = Auto-set by Railway PostgreSQL
- `DISABLE_STARS_FLASK` = 1

**Optional Variables:**
- `TON_WALLET_ADDRESS` = Your TON wallet address
- `PORT` = Auto-set by Railway (usually 8080)

### 6. Deploy Worker Service (Optional)
1. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select same repository: `yourusername/i3lani-bot`
3. Change start command to: `python worker.py`
4. Set same environment variables as bot service

## Configuration Files

### railway.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "nixpacks"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python deployment_server.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "on_failure"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Setup
```bash
# Required
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
ADMIN_IDS=your_telegram_user_id
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (auto-set)
DISABLE_STARS_FLASK=1

# Optional
TON_WALLET_ADDRESS=UQDZpONCwPqBcWezyEGK9ikCHMknoyTrBL-L2hATQbClmulB
```

## Architecture Options

### Option 1: Single Service (Recommended)
- **Service:** Bot + Background tasks in one container
- **Database:** Railway PostgreSQL
- **Cost:** ~$1-2/month within free credits
- **Setup:** Easiest, one deployment

### Option 2: Multi-Service 
- **Service 1:** Bot web server (`deployment_server.py`)
- **Service 2:** Background worker (`worker.py`)
- **Database:** Railway PostgreSQL
- **Cost:** ~$2-3/month
- **Setup:** More complex but better separation

## Deployment Commands

Railway auto-detects your Python app and runs:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start application
python deployment_server.py
```

## Post-Deployment

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Service should show "Active" status
- Database should show "Running"
- Check logs for any errors

### 2. Test Your Bot
1. Open Telegram
2. Search for your bot
3. Send `/start` command
4. Bot should respond with language selection

### 3. Monitor Usage
- Railway dashboard shows resource usage
- Monitor credit consumption
- Check logs for performance issues

## Advantages Over Render

### Performance
- **Railway:** Usually faster cold starts
- **Render:** Can be slower on free tier

### Database
- **Railway:** Integrated PostgreSQL setup
- **Render:** Separate database service

### Pricing
- **Railway:** $5 credits monthly
- **Render:** Usage-based, can run out faster

### Interface
- **Railway:** Cleaner, more modern UI
- **Render:** More traditional hosting interface

## Free Tier Limits

### Railway Free Tier
- $5 worth of credits monthly
- 500 hours of execution time
- 1GB RAM per service
- 1GB storage per database

### Estimated Usage
- **Small bot:** ~$1-2/month
- **Medium bot:** ~$3-4/month
- **Large bot:** May exceed free tier

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify `BOT_TOKEN` is correct
3. Check service logs for errors
4. Ensure `railway.json` is in repository

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is auto-set
2. Check PostgreSQL service is running
3. Restart both services if needed

### Out of Credits
1. Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
2. Optimize code to reduce resource usage
3. Consider upgrading to paid plan ($5/month)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Railway automatically monitors `/health` endpoint

2. Deploy to Railway with same settings
3. Update DNS/webhooks if needed

### From Heroku
1. Use same repository
2. Convert `Procfile` to `railway.json`
3. Migrate database if needed

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
