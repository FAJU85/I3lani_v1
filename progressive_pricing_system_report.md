# Progressive Pricing System Implementation Report

## âœ… Changes Successfully Implemented

### 1. **Base Price Fixed to Start from $0.29**
- **Previous Issue**: Base price calculations could go below $0.29
- **Solution**: Applied minimum final price of $0.29 after discount calculations
- **Result**: All campaigns now have a minimum price of $0.29 regardless of duration

### 2. **Progressive Posts Per Day Rate System**
- **Previous Issue**: Posts per day formula was not aggressive enough
- **Solution**: Implemented tiered progressive scaling based on campaign duration
- **New Algorithm**:
  - 1 day = 1 post/day
  - 2-3 days = 2 posts/day
  - 4-5 days = 3 posts/day
  - 6-7 days = 4 posts/day
  - 8-10 days = 5 posts/day
  - 11-14 days = 6 posts/day
  - 15-21 days = 8 posts/day
  - 22-30 days = 10 posts/day
  - 31+ days = 12 posts/day (maximum)
